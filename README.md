# CompLing23 Coding Workshop #


---

In this workshop, you will get introduced to programming principles, project management, cloud computing, and version control.

The course will be based on the programming language `Python`. No prior knowledge about `Python` is required.

We have in total 6 x 2 hours together, so it is gonna be some compact and informative lessons.
We will be multiple instructors throughout the day to help you get through the workshop in the best manner.

The course is taught by [Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus](https://chcaa.io/#/), any inquiries can be addressed to:

* Kristoffer Nielbo - Wednesday morning 
* Stephan Smuts - all 
* Mia Jacobsen - Thursday 
* Rebekah Baglini - as available, Wednesday and Thursday 

## Technicalities

## How to find help?
If you have a problem, these are the steps we recommend:

0) Isolate the problem, what is going wrong and where?
1) Reexamine the reading, often it contains relevant information.
2) Check if the course  [issues](https://github.com/auNLP/CompLing23-Coding-Workshop/issues) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) has an answer to your problem. 

If you still can't solve the problem:

3) Produce a minimal example of the problem, i.e. somethings which allow others to reproduce the error.

If the problems is general:

4) Ask in on an online help forum e.g. StackOverflow, or Cognitive Science [CogOverflow](https://www.facebook.com/groups/340151913001608/).

If the question if course specific:

4) Create an [issue](https://github.com/auNLP/CompLing23-Coding-Workshop/issues) on the GitHub.
