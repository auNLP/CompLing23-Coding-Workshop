# Scientific Computing 01 #


This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on a weekly basis.

Keep yourself updated on changes in the [CURRICULUM](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/scientific-computing-01/blob/main/CURRICULUM.md)

---

In this workshop, you will get introduced to programming principles, project management, cloud computing, and version control.

The course will be based on the programming language `Python`. No prior knowledge about `Python` is required.

We have in total 6 x 2 hours together, so it is gonna be some compact and informative lessons.
We will be around 3-4 instructors each time to help you get through the workshop in the best manner.

The course is taught by [Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus](https://chcaa.io/#/), any inquiries can be addressed to:

* Ida Marie Lassen: idamarie@cas.au.dk
* Kenneth Enevoldsen: kenneth.enevoldsen@cas.au.dk
* Lasse Hansen: lasse.hansen@clin.au.dk

## Technicalities
We will help you set up all requirements in the first class.
Bring your own laptop.

You should all have a WAYF login in order to sign in to Ucloud.


## How to find help?
If you have a problem, these are the steps we recommend:

0) Isolate the problem, what is going wrong and where?
1) Reexamine the reading, often it contains relevant information.
2) Check if the course  [issues](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/scientific-computing-01/issues) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) has an answer to your problem. 

If you still can't solve the problem:

3) Produce a minimal example of the problem, i.e. somethings which allow others to reproduce the error.

If the problems is general:

4) Ask in on an online help forum e.g. StackOverflow, or Cognitive Science [CogOverflow](https://www.facebook.com/groups/340151913001608/).

If the question if course specific:

4) Create an [issue](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/scientific-computing-01/issues) on the GitHub.
